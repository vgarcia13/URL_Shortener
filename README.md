# URL Shortener

Django URL shortener project, designed and developed by Victor H. Garcia ([@vgarcia13](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-hugo-garcia-202b1b99/))

In this case, I decided to keep it simple, with a standard Django 2.2 project and Python 3.7 interpreter. 

About the front-end, I use "django-bootstrap4" as the CSS framework and simple JQuery statements to reach both
POST and GET endpoints. 

The UI I propose is minimalistic, completely responsive and very intuitive, taking care of the UX design as well.

The project is fully "dockerized" and was deployed to a Heroku instance (for simplicity and time)
